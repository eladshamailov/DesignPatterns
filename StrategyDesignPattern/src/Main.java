        We create animal class and Dog,Shark and mouse classes that extend Animal
        The Runs insatnce has one function , isRun().
         In the Animal class , we use an instance variable that is a subclass of the Runs interface.
        Animal doesn't care what Runs does , it's just knows we can use it.
         Instead of inheriting an ability through inheritance, the class is composed
         with objects with the right ability
         We are not inheriting abilities , we are using the Runs that has the desired ability.
        in this way , we can change the behavior at run time.
